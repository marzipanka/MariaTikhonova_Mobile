Question 1:
    Yes, test passed without any troubles.

Question 3:
    Yes, test passed.

Question 8:
    I see 2 drawbacks of my code:
    1) I could use Page Objects in native tests, but I decided that in current situation it's not rational
    because the amount of elements that I had to interact with was not that huge. I would spend more time
    working on page objects than on writing simple code like I did.
    2) I would put all the capabilities into TestProperties class because Driver class looks pretty messy
    because of them. And also I may need to work with those capabilities from other classes, so I would make them
    private fields with getters.
