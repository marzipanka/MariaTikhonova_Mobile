Question 5:
    To run tests on a real device following thing was changed:
      deviceName capability in prepareAndroidNative() method in setup.DriverSetup class
      capabilities.setCapability("deviceName","711HEBRN238CF");


Question 6:
    The algorithm of connecting a real device to Appium was almost the same as connecting an emulator.
    I just changed the deviceName to the name of my phone. I referred to "adb devices" command in command line
    to find out the name of my device.
    As for running tests, I haven't noticed any differences.
